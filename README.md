**Homebrew-Monoid** is a Homebrew Tap which allows you to use the same friendly Homebrew-style CLI workflow for the installation of binary font files from the Monoid family on your Mac.

Initially this was [proposed to be included in the main Homebrew-Fonts repo](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts/pull/364), but it was decided to include only the [main variant](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts/pull/370), and later the [monoisome variant](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts/pull/371). Additionaly, a caveat was included to use a third-party cask for users requiring a different variant. Initially, an opportunity was given to [larsenwork](https://github.com/larsenwork) to create and control this cask, but he [declined](https://github.com/larsenwork/monoid/issues/80). Therefore, this repo was created.

## Contributing
If larsenwork decides to support Homebrew-Fonts and maintain this cask, I will transfer ownership. Until then, I will try to keep up with any changes or new variants. If you notice anything missing, either [open an issue](https://github.com/sscotth/homebrew-monoid/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/sscotth/homebrew-monoid/pulls), and I will make the necessary changes.
